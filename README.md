# Philip's Single-Page Application template #

This template aims to make it easier to create a
modern Single-Page Application using good practices.

Good practices this repo provides:

* TypeScript
* TSLint
* Webpack
* React
* 3rd party dependencies loaded externally using a CDN
* Easy local development

## Prerequisites

Install [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) using whatever
means is most convenient for you, such as Homebrew on macOS.

## Initialization

    $ npm install
 
This creates a `node_modules` directory.

## Build SPA

    $ npm run build

This creates a `built` directory with compiled JS of your SPA.

## View SPA

Simply open `index.html` from your local filesystem.

Or to start a webserver locally,

    $ npm start

and go to http://localhost:8000.
